# Mindex Coding Challenge
## Synopsis:
**Miguel Rosario - Rochester Institute of Technology - Software Engineering**

Received via email on: 2/26/2021, from **Shemeka Elliott**.

Started on: 2/27/2021 at 1:30 pm EST

Completed on: 2/27/2021 at 6:47 pm EST

Time spent: ~ 5 hours 17 minutes

The challenge was fun and engaging. I have never used `Sprint Boot` before, but it was not bad! I spent a brief period
of time ensuring that the environment was correctly set up. I had to downgrade to JDK 14.0.2 to get the environment
correctly configured and then reset my PATH. The completion of this allowed me to compile and run the
provided code with no issue. Although I did not have much experience (asides from plenty of Java experience),
I believe that I have adequately completed the provided tasks appropriately. 

I have documented the code that I have implemented as well for thoroughness. 

### Lastly,
Thank you for your time, consideration, and the opportunity to display my Software Engineering abilities.
I look forward to hearing back from the Mindex team!
